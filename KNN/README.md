# KNN Classifier

KNN is one of the most simple machine learning algorithm. For a given input, it computes the euclidian distance to all of the other points in the dataset. You must also provide the algorithm with a k value. It then selects the k closest points and assumes that your input is the same class as whichever the k closest points are. A better description can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm

This model has a maximal accuracy of 79.6% when k=7
